<h2 color: white;>I love you so fucking much, I want you forever and ever cause you make me so damn happy. Im so happy I had my first valentines with you, even though you arent with me physically, Ive never been this happy in my life, you make me feel things I have never felt. Also 19 years of looking for someone paid off because I found the perfect one, parents would approve too ;). I love you, and I will love you forever no matter what. Keep being you because you are so worth everything and anything, I love you Mil <3 </h2>
